if drug1 can not be interrupted , close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of drug2 tablets , for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour .
the rate and extent of drug1 absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant drug2 .
the bioavailability of drug1 was reduced by drug2 , however , and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ace inhibition .

drug drug interactions : the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug1 capsules and other drug2 have not been determined .
however , interactions may be expected and drug1 capsules should not be used in combination with other drug2 .
the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 capsules was investigated .
therefore , drug1 capsules should be used with caution in combination with drug2 , particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg .
results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug drug interaction studies between drug1 and drug2 are inconclusive .
therefore , caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 capsules .

this study evaluated the effect of a potent cyp3a inhibitor , drug1 , on the pharmacokinetics and safety of drug2 .
